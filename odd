First of all, we defined variables in certain classes in the beans package. 
This allows you to exchange data between the target database and the control.
For example, when the user in the User class is pulling from the database, the username 
in the user class in the beans matches the desired username and allows you to receive data
from the database class. Another package is database.The database is the layer that provides 
the communication between the beans and the control package.The database package provides our 
connection with our existing database. And these packages we can make database operations easy.
It contains our basic functions in the class of controls.
The controls package includes of classes that contain the basic functions. 
For example, we need a listing method to list user information. When we call 
this method from where we want it,we can list our data.
